# Aditya Pavale

I am a Computer Science Engineering student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Bengaluru.
My academic interests lie in applying computational techniques to real-world
problems, with a focus on machine learning, deep learning, natural language
processing, and computer networks.

Through coursework and academic projects, I have worked on complete problem
pipelines including data preparation, model or system design, implementation,
and evaluation. I prioritize clarity of methodology and correctness of approach
over large-scale production development.
